                <p id="personal_statement">This idea originated from how searching Body Mass Index (BMI) would 𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘭𝘺 get you flagged in school.  🚩

<br>
So I decided to make a different form of measurement: Forehead Mass Index (FMI). 
<br>
It began as a simple python project, that took in the users input and made basic calculations to provide a basic output. Here was my original code for this project

Then I thought, it had the potential to be more interactive and accessible, maybe as a website. 
<br><br>
CSS was the steep learning curve for me. Although crucial in making a custom design for the website, it was not easy to navigate and write code with. In addition, I had to consider the experience of mobile users and scaling the UI to match their intereface. Despite the struggle, the dn result of using CSS helped give the website an authentic character which the Python Version had lacked.

My favorite part was the logical side of things while programming the JavaScript. While programming the function, I based it on an equation which I innovated:
<p id="latex">
                    \[
                    \text{FMI} = 50 + \frac{\text{volume} - \text{mass}}{4} + X_{\text{factors}}
                    \]
</p> 
I enjoyed making custom functions for each part of the calculation.

Following many helpful tutorials online, I was able to create it using HTML, CSS & JS and Hosted on Github.</p>

                <h2 class="section_heading">Story</h2>
                <p id="personal_statement">This idea originated from how searching Body Mass Index (BMI) would 𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘢𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘵𝘭𝘺 get you flagged in school.  🚩
<br>
<br>
So I decided to make a different form of measurement: Forehead Mass Index. 
<br>
It began as a simple python project, that took in the users input and made basic calculations to provide a basic output using an equation I made up here:
<p id="latex">
                    \[
                    \text{FMI} = 50 + \frac{\text{volume} - \text{mass}}{4} + X_{\text{factors}}
                    \]
</p> 
<br>
<p id="personal_statement">
Then I thought, it had the potential to be more interactive and accessible, maybe as a website. 

My favorite part was the logical side of things while programming the JavaScript.
</p>
<br>
<p id="personal_statement">
Following many helpful tutorials online, I was able to create it using HTML, CSS & JS and Hosted on Github.</p>

From this I learned the basic structure and functionality of websites. I used the same skills gained to create this portfolio website too!</p>
